This steps could be taken as 'Preconditions' since they repeat in scenario:

1. On the main page I tried to search for a hotel, Hotel search function was not working so I chose a rental option.

2. There is a date field and below that a CHANGE DATE button. Both fields are nonsense in my opinion and could be replaced by two datepickers
for the check-in and check-out date. Also, the CHANGE DATE button doesn't do anything.

3. The Shown on Map function (The one with Google's API) doesn't work.

4. I choose 2 adults, 2 childs and 1 infant in the Booking options. Below the total there is a Deposit now USD $0 that shouldn't there since in this page 
there is no option to make a deposit. I click on the BOOK NOW button.



- Booking as a guest / payment on arrival:

5. Now I'm on the Final Book page. 'Book as a Guest User' is chosen as default and I immediately click on CONFIRM THIS BOOKING to verify the mandatory fields.

6. There is a bug when you receive the mandatory fields warning. The 'Email is required' alert is duplicated.

7. I enter an invalid format in the Email field and the alert is also duplicated.

8. Point 6 and 7 are related because it looks like there is a validation for the Email field and for the Confirmation Email field. This could be improve leaving just
'Email not matching with confirm email' validation on the Confirmation Email field. Maybe the Guest Information fields should also be mandatory.

9. After put down the correct information when click on CONFIRM THIS BOOKING, the 'Email not matching with confirm email' validation appear, 
the page scroll up to the 'error' and I was redirected to the Confirmation Page with 'Your booking status is Unpaid' status.

10. When I click on PAY ON ARRIVAL an alert appears asking me if I am sure that I want to pay on arrival. After confirm I was redirected to main page.



- Booking as a logged user / payment on arrival:

5. Now I'm on the Final Book page. 'Book as a Guest User' is chosen as default.

6. I click on the Sign In option and I immediately click on CONFIRM THIS BOOKING to verify the mandatory fields. I get an 'Invalid Email or Password' message for the empty email
and for the empty password. Maybe the Guest Information fields should also be mandatory.

7. After put down the correct information when I click on CONFIRM THIS BOOKING I was redirected to the Confirmation Page with 'Your booking status is Unpaid' status.


8. When I click on PAY ON ARRIVAL an alert appears asking me if I am sure that I want to pay on arrival. After I confirm the page reloads and the status changes to 'Your booking status is Reserved'.
It doesn't look to specify how I should confirm my reservation, so maybe it would be good to add some steps to do that.



- Booking as a logged user / payment with credit card:

5. Now I'm on the Final Book page. 'Book as a Guest User' is chosen as default.

6. I click on the Sign In option and I immediately click on CONFIRM THIS BOOKING to verify the mandatory fields. I get an 'Invalid Email or Password' message for the empty email
and for the empty password. Maybe the Guest Information fields should also be mandatory.

7. After putting down the correct information when I click on CONFIRM THIS BOOKING I was redirected to the Confirmation Page with 'Your booking status is Unpaid' status.

8. I click on PAY NOW and the payment options are displayed. I enter fake CC data and when a click on Pay I get this error:
 'THE MERCHANT LOGIN ID OR PASSWORD IS INVALID OR THE ACCOUNT IS INACTIVE.'
This seems to be inaccurate since in any step I entered that kind of information.
